# morse-translator
During week 5 of the _nology course we were given a challenge to create an "English to morse" translator. The extension to the challenge was to make it work "morse to English" too which I successfully implemented. 

## Technologies used
HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript

## How it works
  The translator recognises letters and numbers only, and can translate them both directions. Morse code translated from English will have 1 space between characters and 2 spaces between words. When translating morse to English it will recognize the very same pattern. 
  - The translator works with a JS object where characters/numbers are the keys and their morse code equivalent is the value.
